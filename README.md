# FootballScoreBoard
provide the implementation of the Live Football World Cup Score Board.
Live Football Scoreboard Library is a streamlined tool for managing ongoing football matches and displaying them on board. 
I opted for a Dictionary as the data store due to its efficiency, performance and unique key enforcement. 
The methods follow real-world conventions: 
StartMatch adds matches with team names, 
UpdateScore updates scores, 
FinishMatch marks matches as finished, 
GetSummary orders matches first by total score and then by their addition order. 
This approach simplifies match management, aligns with SOLID principles, and ensures efficient and unique match handling.
